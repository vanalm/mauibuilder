chatbot for accessing building code information

The idea here was to prototype a chatbot to make accessing building code information on the fly easier. I spent about 0 minutes with prompt engineering or optimizing anything, but the basic architecture of the prototype is proven. 

Flask app running on local host, pinecode vector database and similarity search, openai embedding model, and gpt3.5-turbo reponse generator.
